### My idea for an app
As a college student, Iâ€™ve noticed many students scramble when moving in and out of campus housing. Moving is a pain, and a lot of furniture is thrown away rather than sold or kept. A useful app to solve this problem would allow students to sell, trade, or rent furniture among themselves. A user could post furniture items they are looking for or getting rid of, and with map integration find a spot to make the transfer. Sellers would be given user ratings to mitigate the risk of scams or poor service. If an organization behind the app scaled, it could act as the middle-man, collecting furniture to be cleaned and redistributed among students at their convenience.
